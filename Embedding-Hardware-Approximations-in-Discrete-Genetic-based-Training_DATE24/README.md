# Embedding Hardware Approximations in Discrete Genetic-based Training for Printed MLPs
Using a genetic-based training which embedds hardware approximation during training, achieving a sweet balance between area and accuracyMLPs. 
This apporach succesfully printed-powered the use-cases with the smallest printed-powered source i.e., energy-harvester enabling self-powered classifiers.
