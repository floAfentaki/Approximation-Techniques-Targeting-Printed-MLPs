# Highly-Accurate Sequential Support Vector Machines Targeting Printed Electronics

This repository contains the hardware designs and Verilog implementations of sequential Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized for Printed Electronics (PE). These classifiers achieve significantly lower area and power consumption compared to state-of-the-art printed ML models while maintaining high classification accuracy.
